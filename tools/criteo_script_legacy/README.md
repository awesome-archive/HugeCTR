# Dataset and preprocess #
The data is provided by CriteoLabs (http://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/). The original training set contains 45,840,617 examples. Each example contains a label (1 if the ad was clicked, otherwise 0) and 39 features (13 integer features and 26 categorical features). The original test set doesn't contain labels, so it's not used.
